</div>

## Controls

- **Start**: Begins the timer.
- **Stop**: Pauses the timer.
- **Reset**: Resets the timer to 00:00:00:00.

## How It Works

The stopwatch uses JavaScript's `setTimeout` to update the timer every 10 milliseconds. The time is displayed in hours, minutes, seconds, and milliseconds.

## Customization

You can easily customize the styles in [`style.css`](StopWatch/style.css) to match your preferences.
